# Master-Thesis

Listed below are all the code files used in the realisation of the thesis, with their respective data.
Almost all of the files have already been run, so you can already see the results. 
In the event that you would like to run the code again, you can do so by downloading the data (from Gdrive link) and entering them in the file import steps. 


- file "rewards analysis_Github" (code already runned) --> analysis on correlation and trend over time
      Data on Google Drive: reddit_distr and reddit_distr\\posts  
- file "label_analysis_x_GitHub" (code already runned) --> analysis on labels
      Data on Google Drive:sample_final.xlsx and reddit_distr\\posts 
- file "feature_extraction_all_data_x_GitHub" --> extraction and creation of features for testing the best model on all posts
       Data on Google Drive: reddit_distr\\posts, data_pre_reward_x_final_classification and data_post_reward_x_final_classification
       This code is not runned as a lot of separate files were used for its execution due to the large amount of data and the very long time frame. The aggregated result is shown here.
